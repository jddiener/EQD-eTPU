# EQD-eTPU
This enhanced Quadrature Decoder eTPU driver is based upon the original NXP software. It processes signals generated by a shaft encoder, using two input channels to decode out-of-phase encoder signals to produce a bi-directional position counter along with direction and speed information.  The following enhancements have been added so far:

- support 32-bit period collection for low-speed measurement
- fix the period output to be consistent at all times
- allow input channels to be any 2 channels on an eTPU engine
- fix a potential startup issue with windowing enabled
- provide windowing error status

This software is built and simulated/tested by the following tools:

- ETEC C Compiler for eTPU/eTPU2/eTPU2+, version 2.62E, ASH WARE Inc.
- System Development Tool, version 2.72E, ASH WARE Inc.
